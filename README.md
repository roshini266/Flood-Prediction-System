\# 🌊 Flood Prediction System using Machine Learning



\## 📌 Description

This project is a Machine Learning based web application that predicts the possibility of floods using rainfall and environmental data.  

The system analyzes different seasonal rainfall patterns and related factors to determine whether there is a risk of severe flooding.



The application provides a simple web interface where users can enter rainfall details and instantly receive flood prediction results.  

It helps in early awareness and supports preventive decision-making.
